=== TRANSCRIPTION ===
Hey, Craig. Hi. Hope you're well. I've actually got some beers for you to taste. When I'm next driving past Hillcrest, I'm gonna come and drop them off at the store for you, bro. K, bro. So the green coffee thing, I think it's worth having a conversation about. I see that there's a middle man and a middle man and a middle man. So in my experience, this never works. Lots of people are trying to buy the coffee and sell it on, but, the price of coffee being where it is is just makes the the commodity extremely price sensitive. So the minute you've got one too many people on the supply chain, the the price of the coffee is not competitive. So we've dealt with this many times. But I think because they're in The Maldives, it might be a little bit different. So because they're probably not able to source anywhere else, they they're not really in a position to push back on price that much. But, yeah, the coffee will be expensive because, essentially, we've paid for it to be transported all the way to South Africa. We've cleared into the country. We've now warehoused the coffee, and now we're gonna clear the goods out of the country, and it's gonna travel all the way to The Maldives, and they gotta clear it into the country. So all of this logistics is just gonna ramp the price up, especially now if if you're marking it up and he's marking it up and, in buyer, I think I think will probably push the price or or the opportunity away unless he is in a jam and can't get coffee onto that island any other way. And that might be the case because I've I've won like that in Mauritius where we've got a Mauritian, roaster that buys from us, and he obviously pays a lot for the coffee for the all the the reasons I've just mentioned. So, anyway, I think, it'll be tough to get this one to go through, but it might work. So it's worth having a crack at it. Craig, there's not much money in green. It's hugely volume driven. So we aim to just get, like, 15% margin on the coffee. So there's not a lot there. I can give it to you at maybe 5% less. So if I can just make 10, you can make five. And then this guy, as long as he doesn't get greedy and mark it up too much, you might be able to secure a deal there. I can't give it to you any less than that because I currently already have customers that are buying it, and we are obtaining the full 15%. So I also don't wanna snook any of my current customers where I sell the coffee often, obtain 10%, and then I'm not able to service my customers who are using it every month, and, and I could be getting 15% with them. So let me just check with my my partner on this one, but I think I can probably give it to you for 5% less. Anything in our warehouse, you can have for 5% less. That's not gonna be the challenge. The challenge is gonna be the exportation of the coffee. So all of our coffee is warehoused in Cape Town. That's where our warehouse is. And if they need it in Durban, we'll have to send it all the way to Durban. And that's another 5 or R6 a kilo. And then who is exporting this? Is he exporting it? Are we exporting it? There's all kinds of documents that have to accompany the the cargo as it leaves the country and also enters into The Maldives. So there'll be phytosanitary certificate of origin. Yeah. There's a lot of documents that go with sending a commodity across borders. So probably, we would have to sell directly to them, and then what we can do is you just and we'll just work out what the 5% margin is, and then you invoice us for that. And then we pay you up that out as a consultation fee, something like that. Even better is if they are gonna be the ones importing it, they can arrange their courier guy to just come and collect the coffee x warehouse, so from our warehouse in Cape Town. And then their logistics company handles everything. So they come fetch it. They take it across to the to the airports. I'm sure they'll be is it gonna go by boat or by air? Do you know? Yeah. I think it's it's worth having a chat about. The do you have a coffee? Yes. Can we get a discount? Yes. All of that's not a problem. It's it's the exportation, the documents, and who's responsible for what's in the process that's gonna be the challenge.

=== SUMMARY ===
• Craig will drop off beers for tasting.
• Discussion on green coffee supply chain complexities.
• Price sensitivity due to multiple middlemen in logistics.
• Potential for a deal exists but margins are low.
• Exportation logistics and documentation are significant challenges.
• Direct selling to The Maldives may simplify the process.

=== ACTION ITEMS ===
1. Confirm with partner about pricing adjustments.
2. Discuss logistics responsibilities with Craig.
3. Determine if the coffee will be shipped by boat or air.
4. Check if the Maldives importer can handle their own logistics.
5. Prepare necessary export documentation for coffee shipment.
6. Explore consultation fee invoicing for the deal.

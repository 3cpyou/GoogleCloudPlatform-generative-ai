=== TRANSCRIPTION ===
K. I'll be using his chatbot personally, Craig. It's just a way that I can search, intelligently with the Gmail. Number two, the top five common requests, it'll be how much do we owe these people, or when last did we email that, what's been happening between Julie and Chris, We what's the latest with this? When did this person want us to meet? And when last do we get a email from this person, summarize this email for me? What are the things that we need to do for this person? What are the most urgent emails at the moment? What do we need? What are people waiting? Who is waiting for us to reply to them? So those will be, like, supposed, number two. Number three, do you want the chat bot to surface business intelligence automatically? I'd like it to get there. At the moment, I just wanted to get it working. So let's just get it working first. Should I identify urgent problematic emails practically? Not now. Let's just get it working. Emails. What time ranges do you commonly search for? It's probably not going to be, it's probably not gonna be more than, like, three months, but it might be. So it it's gonna be the first month is probably gonna be the most, likely. Do I wanna search emails by subject with attachment or specific keywords? I'm gonna be using natural language for it, and the script needs to intelligently have a bunch of ways where it's like it could be this way. Let's try that. Let's try that. Let's try that and sort of get the the best answer. So, for example, if I say when what is the last what is the last process we get and not need to look at, like, search for process and then go, okay. There was nothing there or search for process and products and prices and quotes and, maybe an XLS and a PDF document and see which one comes up with the most probable answer. Should it understand business context? I think it doesn't need it doesn't number seven, it just needs to understand the words that I'm saying. It doesn't I'm not gonna ask good questions about that are that it needs to understand who do what. I'm gonna specifically say, what is the latest, process from WMCon? I'm not gonna say what's the latest green bean process. Number eight, do you want thread level responses? Show entire conversation chains versus individual emails. I don't know what that means fully, but I wanted to give me something that I can that that'll get that might give me the information that I need, but then I can reply so I can say, please give me more, number one, and it it gives me the more of it. Number nine, this won't integrate with anything. No. I don't need real time notifications at the moment. For the moment, no calendar. I no. No no different authentications is necessary right now. How detailed should your email summaries be? As short as possible with the most important details in there. No. We don't suggest things like replies. It's only gonna be a chatbot, nothing else. Output formats, bullet points. I like bullet points or tables. What happens when there's no email matches a query? I think broaden search or try a different way. So I think that should probably be hard coded in the script where you can put things like, let's say, the field in SDK or the the field the key name in Firestore for it's whatever could be, whatever might have a email address in it, like from or to or owner or user or whatever it is. Like, if it if it thinks it's gonna be user but doesn't get it user, it needs to try all those other ones. I might be wrong. I might make a mistake in who sent the mail to who received the mail. So I might have said who like, what is the last email from Jules Julie to Rox? But, actually, it was Rox to Julie. So it needs to sort of think broader, but I think it need the broader thing needs to be set. So it's not always having to think and guess what it could be. Only after the set thing. Should it actually should it actually use, like, intellect to figure out what it's saying? How should I and what are biggest names? Most people, I think they should use, like, the context of the conversation, the context of the query to help understand, and then look at assume that it's probably more the more recent one and then broaden the search from there. Should I clarify vague requests? Yes. You can clarify anything. No. Number 20, no emails need to be excluded. Everything is fine.
